1. Young women back then would look into mirrors, hoping to see their future husband.

2. Seeing a spider on Halloween means that a deceased loved one is watching over you.

3. Dogs howling on Halloween can mean that they try to summon the dead.

4. If you hear an owl making sounds on Halloween, that can mean a witch is close, looking for ingredients or casting spells.

5. It is believed that you should not sweep your home on Halloween night; you might sweep away the good spirits.

6. Knocking 13 times on a wooden door is not advised on Halloween, since you might invite a demon.

7. If a cat crosses your path from left to right on Halloween, then lucky you—money is coming your way.

8. Previously, before pumpkins, people used to carve turnips on Halloween.

9. Bats flying in circles three times around your home on Halloween is not a good sign; it could mean that a loved one is about to pass away.

10. Wearing red, in Balkan folklore, was believed to keep vampires away.

Be excited for part 2. For now, have a good day.  
Love, Julie ❤
