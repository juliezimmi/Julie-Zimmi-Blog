    <p class="post-date">Date: June 12th, 2025</p>
    <p>Hello, it is me, Julie, the Halloween lover, and in this first blog post, I want to talk about superstitions that are really interesting.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Young women back then would look into mirrors, hoping to see their future husband.</li>
      <li>Seeing a spider on Halloween means that a deceased loved one is watching over you.</li>
      <li>Dogs howling on Halloween can mean that they try to summon the dead.</li>
      <li>If you hear an owl making sounds on Halloween, that can mean a witch is close, looking for ingredients or casting spells.</li>
      <li>It is believed that you should not sweep your home on Halloween night; you might sweep away the good spirits.</li>
      <li>Knocking 13 times on a wooden door is not advised on Halloween, since you might invite a demon.</li>
      <li>If a cat crosses your path from left to right on Halloween, then lucky you—money is coming your way.</li>
      <li>Previously, before pumpkins, people used to carve turnips on Halloween.</li>
      <li>Bats flying in circles three times around your home on Halloween is not a good sign; it could mean that a loved one is about to pass away.</li>
      <li>Wearing red, in Balkan folklore, was believed to keep vampires away.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Be excited for part 2. For now, have a good day.<br>Love, Julie ❤</p>
